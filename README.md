# ðŸ«˜ My Portfolio

### ðŸŒ± What?
Itâ€™s a portfolio page where I show my skills, contact information and projects. It includes a link to the vercel page where I hosted the project and the github repository with the code of each one.  
It was developed using:
- NextJS
- ReactJS
- Tailwind

### ðŸª´ Deploy?
This project is hosted on Vercel: https://my-portfolio-julbs.vercel.app/

But if you want to run in your machine, just clone it from github and type on the terminal:

     npm run dev
     

### ðŸŒ² Who?
This project was made by me Juliana Daroz (https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianadaroz/) based on a figma design I made using differents inspirations: https://www.figma.com/file/1Ba4Z69zJzveOr0KIkrXAD/Julbs-Portfolio?node-id=1-4&t=vuX1yfbl2SrrQ3oS-0.
